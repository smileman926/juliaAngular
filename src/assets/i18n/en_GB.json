We did not make the decision easy at the time and had to live with criticism for them lately. Nevertheless, we believe that the procedure was required at the time. Various feedback from the market also confirms this fundamental view.\n<br><br>\nNevertheless, we are pleased to inform you that we have taken appropriate measures to provide a fundamental possibility that makes it possible to reactivate the function \"Deskline enquiry pool\". It should be noted that no general activation is possible, but you (as the person responsible for the purposes of Art. 4 GDPR) have to decide whether an activation should be made for your company or not.\n<br><br>\nIf your order from easybooking requires a re-activation of the \"Deskline enquiry pool\" function, please confirm the following checkbox and click on \"Continue to enquiry pool\""

As part of the activation, they therefore confirm that they are responsible for the processing of personal data (also under data protection law) in the enquiry pool and that easybooking as a processor in this context, in particular in the event that claims are to be asserted by third parties, is at fault. and to hold harmless.\n<br><br>\nAt this point, we would like to inform you in principle how the data processed by this function are processed (and in particular stored) in JULIA:\n<br><br>\nThe data is processed,\n<ol type='a'>\n<li>in a first step to generate the offers according to the guest's time requirements and to send them to the guest,<\/li>\n<li>if necessary, to send reminders concerning sent offers to the guest<\/li>\n<li>quite generally to generate the time specifications of the guest corresponding bookings;<\/li>\n<\/ol>\nThe data processed via this function are automatically anonymized as soon as possible\n<ol type='a'>\n<li>the data taken from the function does not lead to an offer within 7 days to the guest,<\/li>\n<li> an offer has expired or<\/li>\n<li>can no longer lead to a booking due to the guest's time constraints,<\/li>\n<li>In general, it is clear that the processed data can not (anymore) lead to a booking.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\nIn the event that a booking is made through the data processed via this function, the retention periods specified in our Privacy Policy apply.\n<br><br>\nThey also confirm in the context of activation that they process the data to be processed in accordance with Article 5 of the GDPR (lawfulness of processing). In practical terms, this also means that invariably requests from a guest may be processed, the requirements of which can be met in full in terms of time (eg, specific duration of stay) and factual aspects (eg presence of the required features (swimming pool, etc.). In this context, we also believe that the purpose of data processing is relevant and, in our opinion, the data processed should therefore not be processed or used for any other purpose (eg sending out newsletters, sending out brochures).\n<br><br>\nYou can also deactivate the \"Deskline enquiry pool\" function at any time. For this please click the responsible button in the opened Deskline Enquiry pool."
